# 15th Nordic Combinatorial Conference

The [Nordic Combinatorial
Conferences](https://www.nordiccombinatorics.org/) are held every third
year – the venue and organisation rotating among the Nordic
countries. At NORCOM, mathematicians from the Nordic countries as well
as from other countries meet and interact in an informal, relaxed
atmosphere. All fields of mathematics related to combinatorics and
discrete mathematics are welcome.
